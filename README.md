# TrimbleGeoDBToDatabase
The TrimbleGeoDBToDatabase tool is used by the National Park Service's Arctic Network Inventory and Monitoring Program to transfer field data collected on a Trimble data collection application to the master database. The tool converts the data in the Trimble geodatabase into SQL insert query scripts.

Information about the Shallow Lakes monitoring program can be found at [Shallow Lakes monitoring program](https://www.nps.gov/im/cakn/shallowlakes.htm)

Documentation is in the TrimbleGeoDBToDatabase_Help.pdf help file.
